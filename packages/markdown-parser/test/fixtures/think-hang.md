<think> **Assessing Translation Needs**\n\n\\n\\n

I've begun by dissecting the core requirements of this translation task. My focus is on synthesizing the Chinese structural elucidation paragraph into a concise, SCI-paper-ready English version. The expert role helps me tailor the language appropriately, and I'm aware of the final format requirements. Next, I need to understand the nuances of the Chinese text.


**Evaluating Initial Approaches**

\\n\\n

My current thinking revolves around the initial approach to this translation. I'm prioritizing accuracy, which means a deep dive into the source text to extract the core scientific meaning. I plan to use my expertise to identify key terms and phrasing to ensure the English version is clear and meets journal standards. Considering Compound 3 requires specialized knowledge.

Here is the translation of the structural elucidation for Compound 3, following standard SCI journal formatting and terminology.

**Compound 3** was obtained as a white powder with an optical rotation of $[\\alpha]^{25}_{\\text{D}}$ –76.7 ($c$ 0.1, MeOH). Its high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) exhibited a deprotonated molecular ion peak at $m/z$ 339.0726 [M–H]$^–$ (calcd for C$_{15}$H$_{15}$O$_9$$^–$, 339.0722), establishing the molecular formula as C$_{15}$H$_{16}$O$_9$, corresponding to eight degrees of unsaturation.

Analysis of the $^{1}$H and $^{13}$C NMR data (Table 3) revealed characteristic signals at $\\delta_{\\text{H}}$ 7.12 (2H, s, H-2$'/6'$) and $\\delta_{\\text{C}}$ 167.7 (C-7$'$), 146.4 (2C, C-3$'/5'$), 139.9 (C-4$'$), 121.4 (C-1$'$), and 110.4 (2C, C-2$'/6'$), clearly indicating the presence of a galloyl moiety. Additionally, signals at $\\delta_{\\text{H}}$ 3.75 (3H, s, –OCH$_3$) and $\\delta_{\\text{C}}$ 52.5 (–OCH$_3$) confirmed the existence of a methoxy group.

To precisely elucidate the structure, the NMR data of **3** were compared with those of the known compound 5-$O$-galloyl-(–)-shikimic acid [Reference]. The spectra showed high similarity in both the galloyl moiety and the shikimic acid skeleton, with chemical shifts and coupling patterns matching well with the reference. Notably, the H-5 proton signal of **3** at $\\delta_{\\text{H}}$ 5.75 (1H, br s) was significantly downfield shifted, consistent with the deshielding effect observed in 5-$O$-galloyl-(–)-shikimic acid. This strongly supported the attachment of the galloyl group to the C-5 hydroxyl of the shikimic acid unit via an ester linkage. The primary structural difference between **3** and 5-$O$-galloyl-(–)-shikimic acid was located at C-7. In the HMBC spectrum (Fig. 2), a distinct correlation between the methoxy protons at $\\delta_{\\text{H}}$ 3.75 and the C-7 carbonyl carbon of the shikimate core at $\\delta_{\\text{C}}$ 168.3 confirmed that the C-7 carboxyl group was methylated to form a methyl ester.

The NOESY spectrum (Fig. 2) exhibited correlations of H-4 ($\\delta_{\\text{H}}$ 4.00) with H-2a ($\\delta_{\\text{H}}$ 2.32) and H-5 ($\\delta_{\\text{H}}$ 5.75), as well as H-3 ($\\delta_{\\text{H}}$ 4.12) with H-2b ($\\delta_{\\text{H}}$ 2.79). These correlations indicated that H-3 is <i>cis</i>-oriented relative to the 4-OH and 5-OH groups. The absolute configuration was further determined as (3$R$, 4$S$, 5$R$) by calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) analysis (Fig. 4).

Based on the comprehensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison with 5-$O$-galloyl-(–)-shikimic acid, the structure of **3** was identified as methyl 5-$O$-galloyl-(–)-shikimate.
