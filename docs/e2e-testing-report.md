# E2E Testing Report

This document summarizes the end-to-end markdown parsing tests added to this repository.

## Purpose

Provide a small, reproducible E2E test harness that validates the parser and renderer handle common markdown constructs and to serve as a base for future coverage expansion.

## What was added

- `test/fixtures/` — directory with representative markdown fixtures:
  - `headings.md`
  - `code-diff.md`
  - `table.md`
  - `admonition.md`
  - `math.md`
  - `footnotes.md`
  - `image-link.md`
  - `checkbox.md`
  - `mermaid.md`

- `test/e2e.markdown.test.ts` — a Vitest test that:
  - reads each fixture
  - parses it via `parseMarkdownToStructure` (using `getMarkdown` instance)
  - serializes a minimal stable structure and asserts a snapshot per fixture
  - includes a small `renderMarkdown` assertion for inline math/code block rendering

- Snapshots — generated by Vitest (placed in the default snapshot location).

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow that runs on `push` and `pull_request` to:
  - install dependencies
  - run `pnpm test`
  - run `pnpm typecheck`
  - run `pnpm lint`

## How to run locally

Run tests (and update snapshots if you intentionally changed output):

```bash
pnpm test -- -u
```

Run tests without updating snapshots:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Typecheck and lint:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
```

## Quality gates (local validation)

- Tests: PASS (73 passed locally)
- Typecheck: PASS
- Lint: PASS

## Recommendations / Next steps

1. Convert snapshots to include more detailed fields in `minimal` serialization (for example, include `children` text snippets or node `meta`), to catch regressions in node payloads.
2. Add fixtures for edge cases:
   - Unclosed fences
   - Complex nested lists with markup inside
   - Escaped bracket edge-cases
   - Streaming fence edgecases
3. Add integration tests for rendering plugins that require DOM or workers (Mermaid, KaTeX worker, Monaco). Consider adding a browser-based test job (Playwright) for those.
4. Configure CI to run snapshots or a visual regression step if the renderer's HTML output becomes more important.

If you want, I can:
- Expand snapshots to be more detailed now; or
- Add the edge-case fixtures and tests; or
- Add a Playwright job in CI for DOM-heavy plugins.

Which would you like me to do next?
