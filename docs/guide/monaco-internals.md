# Monaco Internals

This page covers build and runtime tips for `monaco-editor` when using the library.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add stream-monaco
```

## Vite bundling tips
- Monaco requires worker configuration for production builds. Use `vite-plugin-monaco-editor-esm` or `vite-plugin-monaco-editor`.
- In Vite config:
  ```ts
  import monacoEditorPlugin from 'vite-plugin-monaco-editor'

  export default defineConfig({ plugins: [monacoEditorPlugin()] })
  ```

## Avoid worker-not-found errors
- Ensure the plugin packages Monaco workers where your site expects them (e.g., via `customDistPath`) and verify worker file urls after build.
- If bundling into a library, make sure the peer `stream-monaco` is installed in consuming applications.

## Packaging notes
- The library lazy-loads Monaco only when a `CodeBlockNode` mounts. This reduces initial bundle size and avoids SSR failures.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see `Failed to load Monaco worker`, check that the worker files are present in `dist` and accessible by the built site. The plugin's `customDistPath` can help relocate them.
