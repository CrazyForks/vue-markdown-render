# Docs assets & screenshots

If you're adding screenshots or GIFs to the documentation, please follow these guidelines:

- Keep file size small (use SVG where possible or optimized PNG/JPG/GIF)
- Store assets in `docs/.vitepress/public/` so they are served as static files
- Use descriptive filenames and include a caption under the image
- Prefer SVG for diagrams and small screenshots

Example usage in a markdown page:

![Playground demo](/screenshots/playground-demo.svg)

Thanks for making docs better! Please link the original playground page if you add a screenshot for reproducibility.

Quick try — add an SVG screenshot (example):

```md
![Playground demo](/screenshots/playground-demo.svg)
```
